# Python-project
Project for EE 551 WS- Spring semester
This project was done using the following dataset https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data 
The aim of the project was to establish relationships between the attributes of the customers and total purchases of the enterprise. KMeans clustering was implemented in order to
check for clusters among the customers. Initial data exploration with various plots showed that there were some relationships between the customer attributes and the purchases made.
The most definable relationship was that between the income, number of dependents and the total purchases of the customer.
